#  Stack OverFlow Issues Searcher - SOFIS

SOFIS fetches discussions from StackOverflow - SO, on a given topic using the StackOverflow API, it consults **issues that have been created as of 14/01/2014**, and stores the results in a PostgreSQL database or local CSV file.

The retrieved discussions with negative votes (less than zero) are not listed. It also performs validation to avoid duplicates in the CSV file or the database table.

## Description

**SOFIS** allows you to retrieve StackOverflow issues based on a specified search topic as of 01/14/2014. There are two versions of SOFIS available:

- **SOFIS_CSV**: This version generates a CSV file with the obtained results. It offers a swift and portable solution, enabling you to retrieve and store StackOverflow issues in a CSV format, sidestepping the intricacies of setting up a database; this option is ideal for straightforward analysis and seamless collaboration. 
- **SOFIS_DB**: This version uses a PostgreSQL database to store the obtained results. It is built on PostgreSQL, provides greater power to handle substantial data volumes and in-depth analysis.

## SO API requirement

To use the StackOverflow API and make requests, you will need an API key. Follow the steps below to obtain the necessary credentials:

- Register an account at [Stack Apps](https://stackapps.com/users/login).
- Register your application to obtain the API credentials at [Stack Apps - Register an Application](https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth/register). Here you will obtain a client ID and a secret key for OAuth authentication on Stack Overflow. You will need to provide this key when using SOFIS.  

If you need to consult your SO API data, go to [Your Apps](https://stackapps.com/apps/oauth) on [stackapps](stackapps.com). 

## Usage

As previously described, SOFIS come with two versions, for creating a .CSV file o for adding records into a database table. Additionally, the software has, for each version, a way to be executed. Next are explained the different ways for each version. 

**SOFIS_CSV.** 

1. Executable console file. 

   ![comando de ejecucion](Doc/img/command_execute_console_CSV.png)

    .\SOFIS_CSV_CONSOLE.exe -k "YOUR_API_KEY" -i "search_topic" -u "12-06-2023" -d "\desired\path"

2. Python script. 

   Use the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

   ![comando de ejecucion](Doc/img/command_execute_py_CSV.png)

   python SOFIS_CSV.py -k "YOUR_API_KEY" -i "search_topic" -u "12-06-2023" -d "\desired\path"

   

   For Windows users, at the File Explorer you can double-click on the "SOFIS_CSV_GUI.exe" file to execute the program:


   ![comando de ejecucion](Doc/img/command_execute_gui_CSV.JPG)

   ```
   cd .\SOFIS_CSV\Executables\
   
   .\SOFIS_CSV_GUI.exe
   ```


**SOFIS_DB.**

1. Executable console file.

   To execute SOFIS. Open the terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ![comando de ejecucion](Doc/img/command_execute_console_DB.png)

   .\SOFIS_DB_CONSOLE.exe -k "YOUR_API_KEY" -i "search_topic" -d "SOFIS" -u "postgres" -p "1234" -f "12-06-2023"

2. Python script. 

   ![comando de ejecucion](Doc/img/command_execute_py_DB.png)

    python SOFIS_DB.py -k "YOUR_API_KEY" -i "search_topic" -d "SOFIS" -u "postgres" -p "1234" -f "12-06-2023"

   

   For Windows users, at the File Explorer you can double-click on the "SOFIS_DB.exe" file to execute the program:


   ![comando de ejecucion](Doc/img/command_execute_gui_DB.png)

      cd .\SOFIS_DB\Executables\

      .\SOFIS_DB_GUI.exe

**NOTES**

- When you execute the ".py" or ".bat" files to store issues in a CSV format, a corresponding "SQ.pars.<"issue">.txt" file will be created. This file will store the params of the last query performed for a specific issue.

- To verify the data, execute the following SQL statement in pgAdmin 4:

  ```
    SELECT \* FROM SOFIS_QUERY WHERE title ILIKE '%search_topic%';
  ```


## Using the source code

Before using the SOFIS source code, make sure you meet the following requisites:

1. **Code editor**: If you want to modify to SOFIS we recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). You can download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. **GIT**: Install the version control system GIT from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **Clone the repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BPMN-sw-evol/SOFIS.git`.
4. **Python**: Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install the Python extension in VS Code.
5. **Required Python modules**:
   - requests (for making HTTP requests): `pip install requests`
   - psycopg2-binary (only for SOFIS_DB version): `pip install psycopg2-binary`

If you plan to use the PostgreSQL version (SOFIS_DB), follow the steps below:

6. **Install PostgreSQL**: Download and install the stable or latest version from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

7. **Using pgAdmin 4** (included with PostgreSQL), create a database called `SOFIS`.

8. **Create the required table**: In the `SOFIS` database, execute the `SOFIS_Query.sql` script to create the required table. The script is available in the repository.

   ````sql
   CREATE TABLE SOFIS (
      id_discussion SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      topic VARCHAR(25),
      title VARCHAR(255),
      link VARCHAR(255),
      score INTEGER,
      answer_count INTEGER,
      view_count INTEGER,
      creation_date DATE,
      tags VARCHAR(255)
   );
   ````

## Development Summary

SOFIS utilizes the StackOverflow API to retrieve discussions related to a specified search title. It stores these discussions in a local database using PostgreSQL or CSV file. SOFIS checks if each discussion already exists in the database or CSV file and, if not, and it has a score greater than or equal to zero, it inserts it. Additionally,  provides information on the number of questions found, inserted, skipped due to negative votes, and skipped due to already existing in the database or CSV file.

The database or CSV file stores the following attributes for each discussion:

| Attribute     | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| id_discussion | Unique identifier of the discussion  |
| title         | Title of the discussion              |
| link          | Link to the StackOverflow website    |
| score         | Score of the discussion              |
| answer_count  | Number of answers for the discussion |
| view_count    | Number of views for the discussion   |
| creation_date | Creation date of the discussion      |
| tags          | Tags related to the discussion       |

The development focuses on searching for discussions within StackOverflow whose titles contain the specific platform requested as a parameter. This approach ensures that the obtained data is more contextually relevant to the target platform.

## API Usage Limitations

The StackOverflow API has the following limitations:

1. Maximum 30 requests per second.
2. Maximum 10,000 requests per day.
3. If the daily limit is exceeded, an HTTP 429 error will be returned.
4. The daily request limit is renewed from the next midnight.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a cloud-based database for improved scalability and accessibility.
2. Add functionality to update records individually or specific records based on userÂ requirements.
